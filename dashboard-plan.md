# User Dashboard and Post-Authentication Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the structure, navigation, and flow for the user dashboard that will be implemented as part of the extended comic sharing website. The dashboard will serve as the central hub for users after authentication, providing access to settings, bookmarks, comic uploads, and comic management.

## Post-Authentication Flow

### Authentication Redirect
- After successful login or registration, users will be automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
- First-time users may see a brief onboarding overlay
- Returning users will land on the dashboard homepage

### Authentication Middleware
- Update the existing middleware to redirect authenticated users to the dashboard when appropriate
- Ensure all dashboard routes are protected and require authentication
- Implement role-based access for certain features if needed (e.g., admin vs regular users)

## Dashboard Structure

### Dashboard Layout
- Create a consistent layout for all dashboard pages with:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - User profile summary at the top
  - Main content area
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Consistent action buttons

### Navigation Hierarchy
```

├── Home (/dashboard)
├── Bookmarks (/dashboard/bookmarks)
│   └── Folder View (/dashboard/bookmarks/[folderId])
